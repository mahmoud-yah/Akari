The purpose of this project is to design an application to control 
the process of selling an estate in a way that is easy, simple, and a lot more safer 
than the usual way, based on the blockchain technology using Ethereum smart 
contracts. In a way that the seller can add his property to the system and the buyer 
can easily search for whatever property meets his needs and propose an offer to buy 
it, all the accepted and approved-requests are added to the secure blockchain system 
after changing the owner of the property to the new buyer. Which can protect data, 
streamline processes, and reduce fraud to the minimum.
